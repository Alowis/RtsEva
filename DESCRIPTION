Description: This package is an adaptation of the Matalb tsEVA toolbox
    developed by Lorenzo Mentaschi availaible here:
    https://github.com/menta78/tsEva It contains an implementation of the
    Transformed-Stationary (TS) methodology for non-stationary EVA as
    described in Mentaschi et al. (2016).  In synthesis this approach
    consists in (i) transforming a non-stationary time series into a
    stationary one to which the stationary EVA theory can be applied; and
    (ii) reverse-transforming the result into a non-stationary extreme
    value distribution.
