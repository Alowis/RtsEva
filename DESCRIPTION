Description: RtsEva is an adaptation of the Matlab tsEVA toolbox
    developed by Lorenzo Mentaschi available here:
    <https://github.com/menta78/tsEva>. It contains an implementation of the
    Transformed-Stationary (TS) methodology for non-stationary extreme value
    analysis (EVA) as described in Mentaschi et al. (2016).  
    In synthesis this approach consists in:
    (i) transforming a non-stationary time series into a
    stationary one to which the stationary EVA theory can be applied; and
    (ii) reverse-transforming the result into a non-stationary extreme
    value distribution.
    RtsEva offers several options for trend estimation (mean, extremes, seasonal)
    and contains multpile plotting functions displaying different aspects
    of the non-stationnarity of extremes.
