This package is an adaptation of the Matalb tsEVA toolbox developed by Lorenzo Mentaschi availaible here: https://github.com/menta78/tsEva

It contains an implementation of the Transformed-Stationary (TS) methodology for non-stationary EVA as described in Mentaschi et al. (2016). 
In synthesis this approach consists in (i) transforming a non-stationary time series into a stationary one to which the stationary EVA theory can be applied; 
and (ii) reverse-transforming the result into a non-stationary extreme value distribution.

## Installation

You can install the released version of RtsEva from

[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("RtsEva")
```

Alternatively, you can install the development version of RtsEva from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Alowis/RtsEva")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(RtsEva)
# Load a time series
timeAndSeries <- ArdecheStMartin
# go from six-hourly values to daily max
timeAndSeries <- max_daily_value(timeAndSeries)

# set a temporal window for the computation of running statistics
timeWindow <- 30*365 # 30 years

# Run the non-stationnary EVA
result <- TsEvaNs(timeAndSeries, timeWindow,
transfType = 'trendPeaks',tail = 'high')
```


After fitting the non-stationnay EVA, the package offers functions to 
visualize the plots.
