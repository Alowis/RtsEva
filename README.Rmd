This package is an adaptation of the Matalb tsEVA toolbox developed by Lorenzo Mentaschi availaible here: https://github.com/menta78/tsEva

It contains an implementation of the Transformed-Stationary (TS) methodology for non-stationary EVA as described in Mentaschi et al. (2016). 
In synthesis this approach consists in (i) transforming a non-stationary time series into a stationary one to which the stationary EVA theory can be applied; 
and (ii) reverse-transforming the result into a non-stationary extreme value distribution.

## Installation

You can install the development version of RtsEva from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Alowis/RtsEva")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
#library(RtsEva)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
